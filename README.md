# Multiscale Multiphysics Integrated Simulator for Tsunami
We develop a numerical fluid simulator coupled with a structural analysis. The purpose of this system is to efficiently calculate all stages of a tsunami from source to runup, including structural deformation. 
Specifically, a semi three-dimensional model ([**STOC-ML**](https://www.pari.go.jp/unit/tsunamitakashio/open-software/t-stoc/download/index.html)ï¼›Developed by [Port and Airport Research Institute](https://www.pari.go.jp/en/)) assuming hydrostatic pressure is used from the source to the propagation of tsunami waves, and this is connected to the single-phase Navier-Stokes equation ([**CADMAS-SURF/3D**](https://github.com/CADMAS-SURF/Multiscale-and-Multiphysics-Integrated-Simulator-for-Tsunami/tree/main/Simulators/CADMAS-SURF-3D)), which calculates the sea surface using the VOF method, and then, in order to consider the effect of the gas phase, the single-phase VOF method is connected to the gas-liquid two-phase VOF method ([**CADMAS-2F**](https://github.com/CADMAS-SURF/Multiscale-and-Multiphysics-Integrated-Simulator-for-Tsunami/tree/main/Simulators/CADMAS-SURF-3D2F)) and finally to the structural and ground calculations ([**STR3D**](https://github.com/CADMAS-SURF/Multiscale-and-Multiphysics-Integrated-Simulator-for-Tsunami/tree/main/Simulators/STR3D)), which are calculated using FEM.
