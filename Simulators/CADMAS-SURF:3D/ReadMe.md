# CADMAS-SURF3D
Numerical Wave Tank CADMAS-SURF/3D is a 3D free surface flow simulator based on the VOF method developed by the "Study Group on the Application of Numerical Wave Tanks to Wave Resistance Design". It is widely used as a complement or alternative to design formulas and hydraulic model experiments in wave resistant design of structures.
